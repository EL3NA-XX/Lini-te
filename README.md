#Liniște
<h1>Protagonist: Liniște “Lini”</h1>
Age: 12 <br>
Core vibe: a child who learned to smile like armor <br>

<h2>Personality Breakdown</h2>
Hides pain behind cheerfulness  <br>
Her “happy” persona is almost theatrical — bright voice, quick jokes, exaggerated optimism. It’s not fake, but it’s a shield she built early.<br>

Surpressed rage + hatred  <br>
Not explosive. More like a quiet, simmering pressure. She doesn’t lash out; she implodes.<br>
This gives us so much room for surreal symbolism later.<br>

Deeply loving  <br>
She attaches fiercely to the few people or things she trusts.<br>
Her love is protective, almost desperate — she doesn’t want to lose anything else.<br>

This combination makes her incredibly compelling: a kid who feels too much and hides all of it.<br>

<h1>Visual Design</h1>
